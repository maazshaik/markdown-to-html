Initial Analysis Document.

1. read filename from cmd line 
2. open file, read line by line 
3. switch case :(start)
    3.1 Heading (1-6) - link(any)
    3.2 Unformatted text - link(any)
    3.3 Blank - end unformatted if any

Observations:
1. heading is only 1 line
2. Anything is a paragraph except a heading(# )
3. end a paragraph (if any) as soon as you encounter a blank line or heading
4. link can span multiple lines

test cases:
1. heading alone
2. unformatted alone
3. link alone
4. link with heading/unformatted (start, end, between)

Edge cases:
1. heading without space - ##mm
2. link with missing [,],(,):
    only the url considered as href and text and all other content is <p>
3. remove unnecessary blank lines

Assumptions:
1. Not consider(edge case 2) as link - https://google.com
